# E-Sports Tournament Management System (ESTMS)ðŸŽ®ðŸ—ƒ
Designed and implemented as part of the Advanced Database Design curriculum, ESTMS is a comprehensive database solution for managing E-sports tournaments. The system models the complexities of the E-sports ecosystem by optimizing data organization, integrity, and scalability.

Key Features:

ðŸ”¸Developed an EER model incorporating critical entities such as Teams, Players, Tournaments, Sponsors, Matches, and Tournament Standings.<br>
ðŸ”¸Extracted real-world data from the "Call of Duty Mobile World Championship 2023" to build a data-driven structure.<br>
ðŸ”¸Optimized table relationships to ensure normalization (up to 4NF), avoiding multivalued dependencies and enhancing query efficiency.

Challenges Solved:

ðŸ”¸Designed the Bracket_Match and Tournament_Standings tables while maintaining 4NF, resolving non-trivial multivalued dependencies.<br>
ðŸ”¸Streamlined the PrizePool table relationships for ease of querying and data aggregation.<br>
ðŸ”¸Established clear candidate and primary keys for all entities, ensuring integrity and scalability.

Future Development:

ðŸ”¸Add dynamic attributes such as player performance metrics (e.g., kills, K/D ratios).<br>
ðŸ”¸Expand the schema to support multiple E-sports genres and more complex tournament formats.


This project demonstrates expertise in database modeling and normalization while addressing practical challenges in data structuring and analysis for a fast-growing industry.
